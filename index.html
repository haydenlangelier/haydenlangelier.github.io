<h2> Rails/JS App </h2>
<p> I spent alot of time on my phone. I mean alot.... I am one of the lucky few to have unlimited data and my avg data use is about 38 GB a month. I also made the mistake of getting the 16 GB model, that's not happening next time.  My favorite game is Hearthstone. They aren't many good mobile games TBH.</p>
