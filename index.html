<h1> My Portfolio</h1>
<p> I  recently completed a 5 month immersive software program at Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. During the program I  learned  Javascript, Ruby on rails, Swift/Xcode,  and database design full time. Recently, I built an Augmented Reality iPhone app  and I'm currently working on my next great app idea and strengthening my javascript, Amazon Web Services, and iOS development skills. </p>

<h2> Augmented Reality Iphone App</h2>

<p> I built an augmented reality iphone app called Before and After. It highlights both historic and future real estate developments and superimposes either a past picture or future rendering in 3d over the image in AR. It uses geolocation, points of interests, and image overlay. It was built in a week on small team using the Wikitude SDK, Swift, Objective-C, Xcode, and Javascript.</p>

<h2> Iphone App </h2>
<p> I'm also building another iphone app that should be pretty awesome, still researching what is possible with the API's out there. </p>
