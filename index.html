<p> I haven't been playing my PC much recently. But I'm sure i will get back into later in the year. My GPU kinda crapped out so i don't use my dekstop much at all. But perhaps once i get a new GPU things will change</p>

<p> I spent alot of time on my phone. I mean alot.... I am one of the lucky few to have unlimited data and my avg data use is about 38 GB a month. I also made the mistake of getting the 16 GB model, that's not happening next time.  My favorite game is Hearthstone. They aren't many good mobile games TBH.</p>
