<h2> Augmented Reality Iphone App</h2>

<p> I built an augmented reality iphone app called Before and After. It highlights both historic and future real estate developments and superimposes either a past picture or future rendering in 3d over the image in AR. It uses geolocation, points of interests, and image overlay. It was built in a week on small team using the Wikitude SDK, Swift, Objective-C, Xcode, and Javascript.</p>

<h2> BFL (Rails/JS App) </h2>
<p> I worked on a rails 5/AJAX/HTML/CSS  app for setting up league games. It has a calendar function, dedicated teams, the ability to select a team captain, numerous pages for tracking stats, a page that shows scores and who's winning, etc. It was built using REST convention and has a fully functional database.  </p>
