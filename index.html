<p> I haven't been playing my PC much recently. But I'm sure i will get back into later in the year. My GPU kinda crapped out so i don't use my dekstop much at all. But perhaps once i get a new GPU things will change</p>

<p> I spent alot of time on my phone. I mean alot.... I am one of the lucky few to have unlimited data and my avg data use is about 38 GB a month. I also made the mistake of getting the 16 GB model, that's not happening next time.  My favorite game is Hearthstone. They aren't many good mobile games TBH.</p>

<h2 > Here's my take on my site and <a id="thisone"  href="http://www.ign.com/">IGN.com</a></h2>
<p> IGN.com is way more sophisticated than my site. It doesn't even take inspecting their source code to know there is alot more going on. Tons of tabs, links, pictures, etc. They also have video/ads baked into their website. I recognize probably half of the HTML elements, along with alot of of other code that very vaguely makes sense. Overall it is a great site, but its the homepage for a mini media empire so i would expect it is well developed. Theres lots of meta and scripting tags. and plenty of div tag with their subsequent classes and ids. Im sure we will utlize those quite a bit moving forward. They allow more customization of simliar elements within a webpage. </p>
